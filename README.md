SCONE is open source software for predictive simulation of biological motion. The User Interface for SCONE is in a separate [SCONE Studio repository](https://github.com/tgeijten/scone-studio). For more information on SCONE, including tutorials, examples, community guidelines and documentation, see https://scone.software.

### Installing SCONE (Windows, Linux, macOS)

The fastest way to get started using SCONE is to download and run the [installer](https://scone.software/doku.php?id=install) for your platform. Check [what's new](https://scone.software/doku.php?id=changes) in the latest build!

### Building SCONE

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for instructions on how to build SCONE from source. It is advised to build [SCONE Studio](https://github.com/tgeijten/scone-studio) project instead of this project, since that includes the SCONE user interface.

### Running SCONE

Once you have SCONE installed on your system, be sure to follow the [SCONE
tutorials and examples](https://scone.software/doku.php?id=tutorials:start) to
get started!
